The Dijkstra formalisation and all supporting files are available anonymously from a public \texttt{git} repository~\cite{markert_formalised_2015}.
Documentation for type checking the formalisation is available in the repository.
The formalisation consists of approximately 2,400 lines of Agda and was developed using Agda~2.4.2.1 and~2.4.2.2 and Standard Library version~0.9.
