In this paper we have presented a purely functional implementation of a generalised shortest path algorithm, and proved it correct.
We have made extensive use of dependent types, and some of Agda's more advanced features, such as induction-recursion, to help structure the implementation and proof.

Remarkably, despite the algorithm being well-known, Chen seems to have been the first to verify the correctness of Dijkstra's Algorithm in any proof assistant, when he produced a Mizar implementation in 2003~\cite{chen:dijkstra:2003}.
Later, Moore and Zhang verified Dijkstra's Algorithm in ACL2~\cite{moore:proof-pearl:2005}.
Gordon, Hurd, and Slind verified Dijkstra's reachability algorithm in HOL4 as part of a wider formalisation of the Accellera Property Specification Language~\cite{gordon:executing:2003}.
Fleury verified Floyd's all-pairs shortest path algorithm in Coq, and Paulin and Fil\^iatre later verified Floyd's algorithm again in Coq.

The Dijkstra formalisation and all supporting files are available anonymously from a public \texttt{git} repository~\cite{markert_formalised_2015}.
Documentation for type checking the formalisation is available in the repository.
The formalisation consists of approximately 2,400 lines of Agda and was developed using Agda~2.4.2.1 and~2.4.2.2 and Standard Library version~0.9.
