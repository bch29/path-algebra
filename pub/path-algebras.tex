Fix a carrier set $S$ and call a binary operation \emph{selective} when $x \bullet y = x$ or $x \bullet y = y$ for any $x, y \in S$.
Intuitively, a selective binary operation denotes a `choice' between elements.
We call $\langle S, \oplus, \otimes, 0, 1 \rangle$ a `Sobrinho Algebra' whenever:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\langle S, \oplus, 0 \rangle$ forms a commutative monoid,
\item
$1$ is a left identity for multiplication, and a left- and right zero for addition,
\item
addition is selective, and addition absorbs multiplication.
\end{itemize}
All closure and congruence properties for the operations apply as usual.
Following convention, we capture the notion of a Sobrinho Algebra as an Agda record, \AgdaRecord{SobrinhoAlgebra}.
We use \AgdaField{Carrier} for the carrier type of a Sobrinho Algebra, corresponding to the carrier set $S$ above, obtaining the closure properties mentioned above for `free' as a side-effect of Agda's typing discipline, assuming that there exists a decidable setoid equivalence relation on elements of this type, \AgdaField{\_â‰ˆ\_}.
We use \AgdaField{1\#} and \AgdaField{0\#} for our two identity elements, in order to avoid clashing with Agda's in-built numeral parsing notation for natural numbers.

% For the reader's benefit, in the table below we compare the operations and laws of a Sobrinho Algebra with the more familiar notion of a Semiring---algebraic structures themselves often used in work on algebraic routing:
