Fix a carrier set $S$ and an equivalence relation $\_{≈}\_$.
We call a binary operation on $S$ \emph{selective} whenever $x \bullet y ≈ x$ or $x \bullet y ≈ y$ for any $x$ and $y$.
Intuitively, a selective binary operation denotes a `choice' between any two elements.
With this definition in mind, we call a 6-tuple $\langle S, \_{≈}\_, \_{+}\_, \_{*}\_, 0, 1 \rangle$ a `Sobrinho Algebra' whenever:
\begin{itemize}
\item
$\langle S, \_{≈}\_, \_{+}\_, 0 \rangle$ forms a commutative monoid,
\item
$1$ is a left identity for multiplication, and a left- and right zero for addition,
\item
Addition is selective, and addition absorbs multiplication,
\item
The usual closure and congruence properties for the unit elements and operations apply.
\end{itemize}

% For the reader's benefit, in the table below we compare the operations and laws of a Sobrinho Algebra with the more familiar notion of a Semiring---algebraic structures themselves often used in work on algebraic routing:
% \begin{center}
%   \begin{tabular}{l||l@{\;\;\;}|l}
%   \emph{Operation} & \emph{Semiring} & \emph{Sobrinho Algebra} \\
%   \midrule
% $\_{+}\_$ & Associative & Associative \\
%                    & Commutative & Commutative \\
%                    & Identity: $0$ & Identity: $0$ \\
%                    & ---                      & Selective \\
%                    & ---                      & Zero: $1$ \\
%   \midrule
%   $\_{*}\_$ & Associative & --- \\
%                    & Identity: $1$ & Left identity: $1$ \\
%                    & Zero: $0$     & --- \\
%   \midrule
%   $\_{*}\_$ and $\_{+}\_$ & $\_{*}\_$ distributes over $\_{+}\_$ &
%                      $\_{+}\_$ absorbs $\_{*}\_$ \\
%   \midrule
%   \end{tabular}

Following established convention, we capture the notion of a Sobrinho Algebra as an Agda record named \AgdaRecord{SobrinhoAlgebra}.
We use the name \AgdaField{Carrier} for the carrier type of a Sobrinho Algebra, corresponding to the carrier set $S$ above, obtaining the closure properties mentioned above for `free' as a side-effect of Agda's typing discipline, and assume that there exists a decidable setoid equivalence relation on elements of this type, \AgdaField{\_≈\_}.
We use the names \AgdaField{1\#} and \AgdaField{0\#} for our two identity elements of the algebra within Agda, in order to avoid clashing with Agda's in-built numeral parsing notation for natural numbers.
